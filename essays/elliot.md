# The Prompt
Explain the strengths and weaknesses of
composite monarchies, according to
Elliot.

## Strengths
- Concentration of Power gives you an
  advantage in self-defense.
- Support of local nobles lets power
  remain stable in a climate not
  conducive to stable long-distance
  monarchies.
- You can use one state to put down the
  revolt of another.
- If one state won't give enough
  funding, maybe another will.

## Weaknesses
- Royal Absenteeism was an "inescapable
  feature" of composite monarchies.
- Dependence on the support of elites
  makes composite monarchies "brittle."
