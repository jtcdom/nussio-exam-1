This is the essay I plan to do.

# The Prompt
Explain the strengths and weaknesses of
composite monarchies, according to
Elliott.

Note: this essay focuses mainly on the
_aeque principaliter_ model of composite
states; the version in which subject
states still retain their national
identity.

## Strengths
- Concentration of Power gives you an
  advantage in self-defense.
- Support of local nobles lets power
  remain stable in a climate not
  conducive to stable long-distance
  monarchies.
- You can use one state to put down the
  revolt of another.
- If one state won't give enough
  funding, maybe another will.
- Acquiring another state means
  increased wealth and prestige for the
  ruler.

## Weaknesses
- Royal Absenteeism was an "inescapable
  feature" of composite monarchies, a
  "major structural problem."
- Dependence on the support of elites
  makes composite monarchies "brittle."
- Certain states may want more liberty
  than others.
- Religious difference between subject
  states becomes a huge issue.
- States may feel they are not receiving fair
  treatment, or become jealous of others.

# Essay Map
1. Why?
- Rulers in the 16th and 17th centuries
  sought to form composite states for
  two main reasons: the increased wealth
  and prestige brought on by increased
  territory, and the increased
  likelihood of survival brought on by a
  larger concentration of power.
- However, they met with difficulties
  when they tried to force multiple
  different states into a single union.

2. Absenteeism
- The king could not possibly be present
  in all of his subject states for a
  significant amount of time.
- To account for this, the king must
  appoint an "oligarchy" of native
  nobles friendly to him to keep things
  under control while he is gone.
- This can be an advantage, because in
  the turmoil of a huge state local
  governments are nevertheless stable,
  because they do not depend on the
  king.
- But it creates difficulties as well:
  the need to keep the chosen nobles
  happy can make the composite state
  brittle.

3. Differences
- There is inherent difficulty in
  forcing two unrelated states to be
  part of the same union.
- Religious
  disunity, for example, can be a
  problematic divisive force.
- There can be advantages to the differences,
  i.e., a composite monarch has the privilege of
  using one state to put down the
  revolution of another, or can raise
  money from one if the other refuses
  the burden.
- States, however, can
  become jealous of the good treatment
  other states receive, and resentful if
  they are asked to pay more.
- Some states may have traditional
  restrictions on the power of the king
  that may be irksome for composite monarchs
  based in less free states.

4. Conclusion
- Thus, 
- Composite states give the ruler
  increased prestige, wealth, and power.
- Because the king cannot be present in
  every state, he must manage the
  loyalties of the local nobility, a
  practice that provides stability,
  until you start to lose their support.
- Disunifying influences like religion,
  taxes, and law can cause inter-state
  tension and cause issues in the maintenance
  of a composite state.
