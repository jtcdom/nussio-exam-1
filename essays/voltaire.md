# The Prompt
Explain how Voltaire's _letters_
demonstrate the following common
Enlightement themes: anticlericalism,
empiricism, secularism/toleration,
fundamental doubt, rejection of the
past.

## Anticlericalism
- In "On the Government," Voltaire
  portrays the clergy (and the
  nobles/royals) as oppressing the
  people, demanding huge taxes, until
  the Magna Carta and the rise of the
  House of Commons were able to give
  them some liberty. He points out that in
  "free" England the clergy and nobles are not
  exempted from taxes and duties,
  because those are managed by the House
  of Commmons; this, according to
  Voltaire, is a good thing.

## Empiricism
- In "On Lord Bacon," Voltaire
  characterizes the ages before the
  Enlightenment as holding silly beliefs
  due to lack of empirical science,
  i.e., the Ptolemaic model of the
  Universe. Bacon, then, comes in and
  fixes things, by using empirical
  science to determine his model of the
  universe.

## Secularism/Toleration
- In "On the Church of England," 
  Voltaire says that Englishmen, for 
  whom "liberty is natural," 
  are free to "go towards Heaven their
  own way."
- In "On the Presbyterians," he claims
  that a country with many religions
  will be much happier than one with one
  or two.

## Fundamental Doubt
- Voltaire describes Locke as not
  "jumping to what he doesn't know," but
  rather as moving step by step to his
  goal.

## Rejection of the Past
- Voltaire demonstrates an obvious
  dislike for the Greek philosophers,
  calling Greece the "Infant Seat of art
  and of errors." He hates the
  "opressive" systems that ruled England
  in the past.
- In "On the Lord Bacon" he says he
  thinks substantial forms, etc, are
  stupid.
