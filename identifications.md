# Identifications

## Francis Bacon
Natural Philosopher (Scientist),
Progenitor of the Scientific Method;
proponent of empiricism (data first), as
opposed to Descarte's rationalism (logic
first).

## Rene Descartes
Hugely influential philosopher, the
"father of the Enlightenment." Practiced
Fundamental Doubt > nothing is certain >
"I think, therefore I am" is his first
principle. (This is "rationalistic"
philosophy).

## Deism
Popular religious system among
Enlightenment thinkers; God exists, but
does not actively interfere in the world
anymore ("Divine Watchmaker"). Belief in
Natural Law and the inherent goodness of
our world. Religious activity, clerics,
sacraments not necessary. Christ was not
God; just a teacher.

## Enlightened Elitism
Rationality and education are vital for
the human race, but most people
(peasants) are unable to achieve those
states. As such, the non-thinkers must 
simply be led by the thinkers. Voltaire.

## "What is the Third Estate?"
Pamphlet by Sieyes, claiming that the
Third Estate (commoners) is the most
important part of society, as they do
all of the work. Suggests giving more
power to the Third Estate to reflect
this fact.

## National Assembly
Formerly the Third Estate; took the
power of the entire Estates General unto
themselves, beginning the liberal phase
of the French Revolution. Largely led by
the more moderate Girondist club.

## Sack of the Bastille
The National Assembly, by inciting a
march of the sans-cullotes upon the
Bastille, a city-center thing, forced
the King to withdraw his troops. The
guards fired upon the crowd, and several
of them were killed in retaliation, so
this was the first violence of the
Revolution.

## Civil Constitution on the Clergy
Bill, passed by the National Assembly,
that subordinated the French Church to
the state. Reassigned diosceses to match
existing districts. Outlawed religious
orders. Condemned by the Pope.

## The Vendee
French province that revolted against
the Revolution, motivated mostly by the
attacks on Catholicism. Brutally
defeated by the Revolution.

## Revolutionary Commune
- Also known as the Paris Commune.
Revolutionary government of Paris that
took over from the National Assembly and
began the Reign of Terror. Largely led
by the Jacobin club, and their most
influential member, Robespierre.

## Napoleon's Civil Code
Countrywide code of law replacing the
patchwork of law that regulated France
previously. The Revolution tried to do
this, and even had it drafted, but
didn't have the focus to get it enacted.
Declares that laws must be duly
promulgated.

## Putting Out/Cottage System
Pre-Industrial Revolution system for the
distribution of the processing of goods.
A family with more wool than they could
handle would "put out" wool,
subcontracting it out to other families.

## One Shop/Mill System
With advancements in machinery, wool and
other goods can now be fully processed
in one location; the Putting Out system
is no longer necessary. Large machinery
is difficult to buy, and to fit in a
house, so the average family cannot have
it.

## Consumer Revolution
A consumer revolution is
an increase in the production and
purchasing of consumer goods. A consumer
revolution occurred as a result of the
Industrial Revolution, as more goods
were being produced (in factories), and
families were working more, and had more
disposable income.

## Luddites
The Luddites were an anti-automation
group who resented the loss of their
jobs to machines. They would attack and
destroy the machines of companies, but
were unable to affect change.
